To do...

Don't worry about the left side, just make sure we have absolutely everything ordered that we will need to finish construction.

1) Check on proto labs order?  Where is our mount for the upper stages?  Do we have everything we need there too?
2) ETL.  Run the calibration again, just to make sure that orientation/gravity/whatever didn't change the values.
3) ETL.  Figure out what type of amplitude is necessary to image a specific FOV.

4).  We should measure the magnification of the microscope for all the different settings.  
4a.  Get a micrometer ruler etched glass.  Take images of it at each different magnification, measure the distance between the 
pixels as accurately as possible, and that give microns/pixel.

Start to assemble a table...
Mag.  X-galvo amplitude.  ETL amplitude.
1x 5V...

Where are the beams actually supposed to be placed?  At first, kinda made sense that the beam would be at the 
25% mark for the right, and the 75% mark for the left.
However, that also doesn't really make sense either.  If we have to use the ETL to scan the beam, the rolling shutter will go 
across the entire field of view.  So, presumably, the centroid of the beam should be in the center of the camera.

Once we have a feel for the ETL.  For using the light-sheet mode.  We can put large fluorescent beads into agarose, 
and make sure that the field of view is uniform when in the ASLM mode.  
For us usually, we adjust the x-galvo offset to change the phase of the remote focusing relative to the camera.  

In general, try to understand everything on the 'parameters' page.
